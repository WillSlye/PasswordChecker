Password Checker
The Password Checker is a Python program that allows you to check if a given password has been exposed in any known data breaches. 
The program uses the Pwned Passwords API to check the password, which means that your actual password is never sent to the API directly. 
The program also provides suggestions for improving the strength of a password if it is too weak.

Getting Started
To use the Password Checker, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. 
You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the Password Checker program and run it from the command line. 
To download the program, click the "Download ZIP" button on the repository page, or use Git to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
Usage
To check a password, simply run the program from the command line and pass the password as an argument. 
You can check multiple passwords at once by passing them as separate arguments. For example:

Copy code
python3 password_checker.py password123 123456 qwerty
The program will query the Pwned Passwords API to check if the passwords have been exposed in any known data breaches. If a password has been exposed, the program will display a warning message advising you to change the password. If a password has not been exposed, the program will display a confirmation message that the password is safe to use. If the password is too weak, the program will provide suggestions for improving the strength of the password.
